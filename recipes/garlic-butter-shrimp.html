    <h3>Garlic Butter Shrimp is a rich and flavorful dish and it is super easy to make.</h3>

    <p><strong>The use of shrimp with scales and head make this unique from other versions.</strong> People who are used to buy frozen shrimp
    from the supermarket might find this uncommon. Cooking shrimp in this form is actually a common practice in some Asian
    countries, including the Philippines.</p>

    <p>Dishes such as <em>Sinignag na Hipon, Halabas na Hipon, and Nilasing na Hipon</em> uses cleaned fresh shrimp with head and shell.
    I personally like shrimp in this form because it is tastier. Youâ€™ll find most of the flavors concentrated below the
    head.</p>

        <li>2 lbs shrimp (cleaned)</li>
