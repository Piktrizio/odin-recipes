    <h3>A mix of ingredients come together in this tomato-based stew practically bursting with flavor.</h3>

    <p><strong>Savory, hearty, and undeniably flavorful,</strong> <em>beef caldereta</em> — or <em>kaldereta</em> — is a main course native to the
        Philippines. Mostly popular in the Southern Tagalog region, the original rendition of this dish is actually made
        with goat meat. Caldereta derives its name from the Spanish word for cauldron, <em>caldera</em>. This must be because of
        how your beef is left to cook on low heat in a pot, simmering until it becomes fully tender. Its easy and
        affordable combination of ingredients endears it even further to the Filipino crowd, as they’re easy to source!
        With the beef caldereta recipe so easy to prepare, it’s truly no wonder Filipinos love it so much!</p>

    <p>While this beef caldereta recipe makes use of beef short ribs over goat, the tasty flavors of this meat stew are here to
    stay. Beef short ribs are an easier protein to source at your local supermarkets, and one can never get enough of their
    tender quality. Once you try this rendition, I can guarantee it will definitely become a family favorite!</p>
