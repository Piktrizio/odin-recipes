Recipe Project from "The Odin Project" course

This project will demonstrate what I have learned on the HTML part of the TOP
course such as Headings, Paragraphs, Ordered and Unordered lists, adding
Images, adding Links, etc.

Update 03/28/22: 
Adding a bit of design on the pages using CSS after reading the "CSS Foundation" part of the TOP course
